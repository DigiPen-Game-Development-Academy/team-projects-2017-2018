**Escape Velocity by BitFlame**

  Art Notes:

Animations (player feet and arm, enemy tentacles, resources, ship)
Effects (player damage, bullet trail, comet and trail, enemy death, player death, resource pickup, etc.)
Cutscenes (player death and win)

  Game Design Notes:

Resources and purchases are meaningful.
Progression is shown.
Waves are compelling.
World is filled out and greatly benefits from regeneration option.
Tutorial is almost unnecessary, but is absent and needed for some finer details like reminders to open ship menu.
Compass or other directional indication to get to ship.

  Sound Design Notes:

Sound effects are excellent overall, especially in their working together.
Ambience is fantastic.
Death sound is a little obnoxious, which is not horrible since it is the death sound, but it could be less scratchy and have more bass tones.

  Tech Notes:

Game had only three glitches:
    HUD is clipped on some screen resolutions.
    No mouse cursor on win screen.
    No way to quit the game except dying and then quitting from the lose screen.

  Team Notes:

Only five person team.
Members initially were unintentionally excluding the quieter members.
Team fully melded by the end of the semester.

**Ill Dignified by BlueJays**

  Art Notes:

Animations (player, hermit, and bird)
Lighting (windows, room, spotlight, etc.)
Effects (parallax fool foreground, player walk, bird flap, bomb explode, dust ambience, fool hover, hub petals, and hermit bubbles)
Cutscenes (hub and fool level starts, player death)

  Game Design Notes:

HUD layout and information is very clear.
Very little progression.
Each of the towers does something very different.
Menus are built into the world.
Gameplay is intuitive.
Boss is very simplistic and could be improved with multiple stages (and healing/checkpoints for the player between each).

  Sound Design Notes:

Sound effects vary in quality.
Tower sound effects are awesome, but don't fit with the timing of the attacks.
Walk sound effects are perfect.
Damage sound effects are OK.
Death sound effect is OK.
Death sound is a little obnoxious, which is not horrible since it is the death sound, but it could be less scratchy and have more bass tones.
Music is well done and custom made with a real instrument, but needed accompanyment (possibly percussion or a harmony).

  Tech Notes:

Game had only five glitches:
    After the chariot disappears, the player does not animate.
    Cannot see entire level (screen bounds are limited to too small an area).
    No way to quit the game.
    You can place way too many knights in the win level and get stuck because you can't get to the ladder.
    Using the chariot while on the left edge of the screen gets the player stuck.

  Team Notes:

Only three person team.
Communication and cooperation problems at the beginning of the semester.
Way more cooperation after second milestone.

**Relocation by Gouda Interactive**

  Art Notes:

Animations (player, several enemies, NPC, door, and rover)
Effects (player walk, laser, rover hover, water splash)
Color scheme (distinct per level, understandable)

  Game Design Notes:

Excellent tutorial, but no reminder on how to open the inventory when crafting the gun.
Good progression, but no goal.
Fun to upgrade, but what after?
Ammo system makes minigun extra awesome, because it paces the player and keeps the other guns relevant.
Reloading the gun has to take place outside the inventory.
The player is allowed to build multiple guns of the same type.

  Sound Design Notes:

Sound effects are good overall, but some are better than others.
Music on main menu is epic.
Music on credits screen cuts in quickly, but is also really good.
Music in game is excellent, but quickly gets annoying because it repeats so soon.
Break the monotony with occasional replays of the music or a combat track that fades in for combat and then fades out again.

  Tech Notes:

Game had only three glitches:
    HUD is not fully on screen in different screen resolutions.
    Reloading the tutorial over and over will allow you to mine just the really good resources over and over.
    Picking up items with a full inventory destroys the items, but doesn't add them to the inventory.

  Team Notes:

A lot of team conflict early in the semester, but not later on.
Several strong personalities and several passive personalities made communication strained at the beginning.
Excellent delegation of tasks toward the end of the project, which allowed accelerated progress.

**Substeam by Imperial Scum**

  Art Notes:

Animations (player, several enemies, NPC, and boss)
Effects (parallax, player walk, player spear, player sworderang, cannon, snail spear, explosion fish, lasers, bubbles, etc.)
Color scheme (mostly distinct per level, understandable)
Main menu is not parallaxed and stops animating after ping-pong-ing.
Checkpoints are barely noticable, because the text is small.

  Game Design Notes:

Excellent tutorial and good contextual information ("you are starving" and such).
Good progression and excellent climax.
A lot of fun to upgrade.
Legendary items!
Each enemy feals different except the gear shark and gear piranha (but they look different, so it's mostly OK).
Boss is really satisfying to fight, but the enemies that are spawned in the center of the level are weird.
"Surprise! We've been counting your deaths the entire time!" adds replayability.

  Sound Design Notes:

Sound effects are excellent and fit the game very well.
Buttons on intermission/loading level do not have sound effects.
The balista snails bolt has a good launch sound, but the hit sound is barely audible.
Some sound effects could have been added:
    Checkpoints.
    Landing on the ground after jumping.
    Hitting walls (running or jumping).
    Starving could have used a new particle effect or the same one as damage.
    Being hit by flow zones.
    Picking up different items could have different sounds like the key already does (legendary, food, gears, etc.).
    Geysers and getting launched by geysers.
Running on ground could have been made louder.
Music is fun, but could have used a little more variance.
Break the monotony with occasional replays of the music or a combat track that fades in for combat and then fades out again.

  Tech Notes:

Game had only three glitches:
    The fruit on the island and other sprites here and there were Z fighting.
    Lag on the larger levels.
    Game crashes on exit.

  Team Notes:

Excellent communication, although some personality differences caused some contention here and there.
Coordination and task management were phenomenal.

**Island of Potato by Knights Of The Round Potato**

  Art Notes:

Animations (boat pre and post crash, player walk and attack, torch, several enemies, and boss)
Effects (lasers, enemy movement, boss dizzy, boss shield, sound meter, rocket trail, and stun zone reticle)
Color scheme is excellent on the beach, but on the path and in the forest, things are either a light grey with tiny variation or a deep green/brown with tiny variation.
The sign says "SAVE" on it, but the sign itself and the writing on the sign could be contrasted in color more since the save point is so important.
Cutscene explains the game's shipwreck setting perfectly.
The font can be hard to read at times and could have used a drop shadow or a little more boldness.
The vignette is WAY too extreme and this is not allowed, because remember that strong red vignettes are all about BLOOD BLOOD BLOOD BLOOD BLOOD.
There are many cases of lines being square when they should be curved or dithered.

  Game Design Notes:

Bosses are really satisfying to fight, but the other enemies are just a pain.
The final boss is a lot of fun, except that the sheild is just way too hard to get around.
It is exceedingly difficult to be stealthy, because enemies see you too easily and it is too hard to tell where they are looking.
You can tell where they are, mostly, but you cannot predict whether turning a corner will let them see you.
The two last bosses are impossible without the flashlight.

  Sound Design Notes:

The water and the boat crashing sound effects are excellent.
Player walk sound effect is also great and sprinting accelerates the walk sound effect.
Reload sound effect is broken.
Some sound effects could have been added:
    Fist attack.
    Potato attack.
    Boss level enter.
    Boss ammo stations.
    First stage of final boss.
    Buttons (hover, unhover, press, invalid, accepted, etc.).
Menu and boss music is fantastic, but the first game track to play is a brain numbingly pure tone that needed harmony, rhythm variance, reverb, etc.
The music needed to be decreased in volume A TON by default and the sound effects needed to be boosted a lot.
Combat track fades in for combat and then fades out again.

  Tech Notes:

Game had only five glitches:
    Final boss isn't smart enough to path around things in it's first two stages and there are no missiles, so you can sit at the reload station forever.
    Even with infinite health packs and ammo, you cannot beat the final boss without the flashlight and there is no way to exit the boss fight to get one.
    Lag on the larger level causes gameplay to be too difficult and audio to glitch (yes it is the lag).
    Player character plays the wrong animation when moving up and to the right.
    Music stops playing after respawning in the boss level.

  Team Notes:

Excellent task tracking on Trello, but very rarely any communication on Discord.
A lot of team communication was missing outside of class, including what people were working on or wanting to add to the game.
Less directed during beginning of the project, but by the end, they knew what they wanted.
